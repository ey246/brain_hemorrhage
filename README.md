# ðŸ§  Brain Hemorrhage Detection using Deep Q-Learning

This repository contains a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN) implementation for brain hemorrhage localization in CT scan images. The model uses a CNN-based feature extractor (VGG16) and is trained to iteratively move a bounding box toward the hemorrhage region using reward signals.
